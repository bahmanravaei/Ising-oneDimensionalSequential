# Ising-oneDimensional
Ising Model simulation with MCMC


<code style="color : red">NOTE: THESE IMPLEMENTATION ARE BASED ON DA PAPER, THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT THE BASED IMPLEMENTATION OF ISING MODEL. </code> 

In this repository, there are two different implementations of Ising Model based on DA paper:
  1) Sequential Model
  2) Parallel Model
The first version is a sequential model which is faster and simpler than the other one. 

The main reason for effeincy of the sequential model is that the Proposed method in DA Paper is assumed to executed by a FPGA, Not the simulation way. Therefore, I suggest to perform the sequentiol version of this.
