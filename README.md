# Ising-oneDimensional
Ising Model simulation with MCMC

In this repository, there are two different implementations of Ising Model based on DA paper:
  1) Sequential Model
  2) Parallel Model
The first version is a sequential model which is faster and simpler than the other one. 

The main reason for effeincy of the sequential model is that the Proposed method in DA Paper is assumed to run on a hardware, Not by a software.
